# react-component-library

This library is an example on how to make an NPM package that can be reused in other apps.

This package exports two kinds of buttons:
- Button: a button that uses MUI (@mui/material). You can pass the `label`, `variant`, `color` and `onClick` as a `prop`
- Button2: just an html button. You can pass the `label` and `onClick` as a `prop`
